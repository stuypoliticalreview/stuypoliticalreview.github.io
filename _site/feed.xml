Founded in the 2025–2026 school year, SPR was created to fill a unique gap in Stuyvesant’s club landscape by offering a publication-based, non-competitive platform for political writing and analysis. While other clubs focus on debate, casual discussion, or broader journalism, none combine non-partisan political research, long-form student writing, and a collaborative editorial process the way we do.</p>

<p>Our mission is to create an open and welcoming space where students can explore important political topics through in-depth research, publication, and constructive dialogue. In an era where political awareness is more important than ever, SPR helps members become informed citizens, critical thinkers, and effective communicators. Articles are published twice a year, once in the fall and once in the spring, and we welcome new members at any time.</p>

<p>This year, our goals are to recruit a strong base of members, set up a sustainable meeting structure, publish our first two issues, and establish a polished online presence. We are aiming for around 15 active members by the end of the year, along with a fully functioning website, a clear leadership team, and a welcoming community for new writers.</p>

<p>Our leadership team will include two Co-Editors-in-Chief, a Managing Editor, a Web Editor, a Copy Editor, and a Treasurer. Together, they oversee the editorial vision, manage the publication process, maintain our digital platforms, ensure factual accuracy, and handle budgeting and fundraising. All positions are designed to keep the club running smoothly while maintaining high editorial standards and a non-partisan voice.</p>

<p>A typical SPR meeting blends collaboration, discussion, and independent work. We begin with a rundown of recent political events to spark discussion and article ideas. Members then transition into a writer’s workshop where they can share progress, receive feedback, and work with editors on research and structure. Those still brainstorming can develop ideas, start research, or collaborate with others. As publication deadlines approach, meetings focus on reviewing submissions and preparing content for release. We also plan to host guest speakers who can share insights on political topics relevant to our work.</p>

<p>Meetings will be held once a week for about an hour, with a structured agenda to keep discussions productive. We pause during major exam periods to respect academic priorities, but members can continue to collaborate online.</p>

<p>If you are interested in writing, politics, public policy, or simply becoming a more informed and thoughtful citizen, the Stuyvesant Political Review offers a space to explore your ideas, develop your skills, and share your voice with the community.

Purpose</h1>
<p>The Stuyvesant Political Review (SPR) aims to inform the Stuyvesant student body with diverse analysis and truthful reporting. From international conflicts to local affairs, it’s imperative to our mission that we remain accurate and respectful, while not infringing on the freedoms of our reporters.</p>

<p>We are in an age of unprecedented connectivity where information can be spread at near instant rates, however a byproduct of this is the rise of misinformation and unfactual reporting. Due to this, it’s expected that SPR reporters regardless of their speciality, should substantiate their writing with a variety of sources and follow the ethical guidelines in this document.</p>

<h1 id="section-2-core-principles">Section 2. Core Principles</h1>
<p>The review’s work is grounded in a set of core principles that guide every stage of reporting, writing, and editing. First and foremost, we value integrity, ensuring that our work is honest and free from fabrication or manipulation. We strive for accuracy, verifying facts and presenting information in a clear and reliable manner. Fairness is equally essential and we aim to represent multiple perspectives and avoid distorting or omitting key facts that could mislead readers, while still presenting compelling arguments.</p>

<p>We uphold independence, resisting outside pressure, personal bias, or influence from groups or individuals who may seek to shape our coverage. Finally, we are committed to respect, both for our audience and for the individuals and communities we cover, understanding that words have impact and must be used responsibly. Together, these principles define the standard of professionalism and trust that the review aims to meet in every publication.</p>

<h1 id="section-3-transparency">Section 3. Transparency</h1>
<p>The review’s credibility depends on openness with its readers. Reporters and editors must disclose all sources of information, whether primary, secondary, or background, and clearly differentiate between fact, opinion, and analysis.</p>

<p>Any conflicts of interest, whether personal, academic, or organizational, must be stated openly to avoid even the appearance of bias. The review’s editorial process should also be clear and accessible so readers understand how stories are researched, written, and approved for publication. Transparency is not only a safeguard against doubt; it is a proactive commitment to building and maintaining trust.</p>

<h1 id="section-4-accuracy-and-verification">Section 4. Accuracy and Verification</h1>
<p>The review prioritizes accuracy as the foundation of trustworthy journalism. Reporters must rigorously verify all facts by consulting multiple credible sources whenever possible. This includes confirming dates, names, statistics, and quotations, ensuring every detail is correct and placed in the appropriate context. Relying on a single unverified source is not acceptable, as it increases the risk of spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>Verification is an ongoing responsibility that extends beyond the initial publication. Reporters and editors must remain vigilant in monitoring stories, ready to update or clarify information as new facts emerge. When discrepancies or errors are identified, the review must act quickly to investigate and correct them.</p>

<p>Transparency is crucial when issuing corrections as outlined in section 11. The review will clearly inform readers of any changes made to previously published work, explaining what was incorrect and how it was resolved. This openness reinforces our commitment to integrity and helps maintain the trust of our audience.</p>

<h1 id="section-5-source-use-and-attribution">Section 5. Source Use and Attribution</h1>
<p>The review respects the importance of proper source attribution in maintaining journalistic integrity. All information gathered from external sources must be clearly credited to its origin. Whether quoting directly, paraphrasing, or summarizing, reporters are responsible for providing accurate citations to allow readers to verify and explore the original material.</p>

<p>Sources should be credible and relevant. The review encourages the use of primary sources such as interviews, official documents, and direct data whenever possible. Secondary sources must be trustworthy, and reporters should evaluate their reliability critically before including their information. Anonymous sources may be used only when absolutely necessary and with editorial approval, accompanied by an explanation of the reasons for anonymity.</p>

<p>To maintain clarity and transparency, the review requires that all sources be cited using markdown formatting. This ensures citations are clear, consistent, and easy to follow both within the text and in reference lists. Reporters should familiarize themselves with basic markdown citation styles and seek editorial guidance when needed.</p>

<p>Misrepresenting, fabricating, or manipulating sources in any way is strictly prohibited. The review’s commitment to accurate attribution helps protect the rights of original creators and upholds the trust between reporters and readers.</p>

<h1 id="section-6-originality-and-no-plagiarism">Section 6. Originality and No Plagiarism</h1>
<p>The review demands that all content be original and produced by the reporters themselves. Plagiarism, copying another’s work without proper attribution, is strictly forbidden and undermines the credibility of the entire publication. Reporters must ensure that all ideas, words, and media that are not their own are clearly cited according to the guidelines in Section 5.</p>

<p>Using content generated by AI tools without explicit disclosure is also prohibited unless it is limited to research assistance and properly acknowledged. The review encourages creativity and authentic voice, and any suspected cases of plagiarism or undisclosed AI use will be reviewed seriously and may result in disciplinary action.</p>

<h1 id="section-7-ai-usage-policy">Section 7. AI Usage Policy</h1>
<p>The review prohibits the use of AI tools for writing, generating, or sourcing content. Reporters may not rely on AI to produce any part of their work, as this undermines authenticity and accountability. AI may not be used in any capacity that affects the content or sources of a story.</p>

<h1 id="section-8-bias-and-fairness">Section 8. Bias and Fairness</h1>
<p>The review is committed to minimizing bias in all its reporting. While complete objectivity is impossible, reporters must strive to present balanced perspectives by including diverse viewpoints and avoiding personal opinions unless clearly identified as such.</p>

<p>Fairness requires careful attention to language and framing to prevent misleading or unfair portrayals of individuals, groups, or events. The review’s goal is to inform readers honestly and without distortion.</p>

<h1 id="section-9-respect-and-sensitivity">Section 9. Respect and Sensitivity</h1>
<p>The review recognizes that words have power and impact beyond mere information. Reporters must approach subjects with respect and avoid language or framing that perpetuates harmful stereotypes, discrimination, or prejudice. Sensitivity to the diverse backgrounds and identities within our community is essential to responsible journalism.</p>

<p>Privacy is also a key concern. The review will protect individuals’ privacy rights, especially in sensitive situations, and avoid unnecessary intrusion into personal matters unless there is a clear public interest. Consent should be obtained when appropriate, and anonymity respected when requested and justified.</p>

<p>Respect extends beyond individuals to the communities and cultures covered. The review encourages reporters to engage thoughtfully and avoid sensationalism or exploitation. Responsible storytelling strengthens trust and fosters a more inclusive environment for readers and sources alike.</p>

<h1 id="section-10-editorial-independence">Section 10. Editorial Independence</h1>
<p>The review maintains full editorial independence from any external influences, including school administration, student groups, advertisers, or other organizations. Reporters and editors must make decisions based on journalistic merit and ethical standards alone, free from pressure or interference.</p>

<p>This independence protects the integrity and credibility of The review. Staff members should feel empowered to pursue stories and express ideas without fear of censorship or retaliation, ensuring that the publication remains a trusted and autonomous voice within the Stuyvesant community.</p>

<h1 id="section-11-corrections-and-accountability">Section 11. Corrections and Accountability</h1>
<p>The review values accountability as a key part of maintaining trust with its readers. When errors are identified in published content, they must be corrected promptly and transparently. Corrections should be clearly communicated to the audience, specifying what was incorrect and how it was amended.</p>

<p>Accountability also means that reporters and editors take responsibility for their work, acknowledging mistakes and learning from them. The review encourages an environment where feedback is welcomed, and ethical concerns can be raised without fear of reprisal.</p>

<h1 id="section-12-implementation-and-review">Section 12. Implementation and Review</h1>
<p>The review’s ethics guidelines serve as a foundation for our journalistic work and are crucial in maintaining the publication’s integrity and trust with its audience. Every staff member, from reporters to editors, is expected to thoroughly understand and consistently apply these principles in their daily tasks. Ethical journalism is a shared responsibility that requires vigilance, honesty, and commitment at every level.</p>

<p>To remain effective, these guidelines will be reviewed and updated regularly to address new ethical challenges, technological developments, and changes within the school community. The review encourages ongoing dialogue among staff members about ethical dilemmas and best practices, fostering an environment where questions and concerns can be raised openly and constructively. This adaptability helps ensure that the guidelines stay relevant and practical over time.</p>

<p>Finally, the review invites feedback from its readers as well as its team, recognizing that a healthy relationship with the community it serves strengthens accountability and transparency. By actively engaging with its audience and reflecting on its practices, the review aims to uphold the highest standards of journalistic ethics and continue building trust within the Stuyvesant community.</p>]]></content><author><name>the SPR Editoral Board</name></author><category term="meta" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The review has a strict set of ethical guidelines and best practices to ensure thoughtful and substantiated articles.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/articles/ethics.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/articles/ethics.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Stuyvesant Political Review’s Style Guidelines</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/08/style.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Stuyvesant Political Review’s Style Guidelines" /><published>2025-08-08T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-08-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/08/style</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/08/style.html"><![CDATA[<p>The review maintains a formal yet accessible tone throughout all its articles. Writers should aim for clarity and conciseness, avoiding unnecessary jargon while keeping the content informative and engaging. Active voice is preferred as it creates a more direct and compelling narrative. Slang and overly casual expressions should be avoided since the audience, though primarily high school students, expects a polished and respectful style. Opinions must be clear and supported by evidence from multiple sources.</p>

<p>Regarding grammar and usage, the review follows American English conventions, including punctuation and spelling. The Oxford comma is mandatory in all lists to prevent ambiguity. Writers should spell out numbers from one through nine, while numerals are used for 10 and above; exceptions include ages, percentages, and measurements, which should always be in numeral form. While split infinitives are generally discouraged, clarity should never be sacrificed for strict grammatical adherence.</p>

<p>In formatting, headlines use title case, capitalizing major words, while subheadings employ sentence case, capitalizing only the first word and proper nouns. Paragraphs are kept short and digestible, ideally ranging from three to five sentences to maintain reader engagement. Markdown formatting is used consistently, with italics for emphasis and bold for strong emphasis. Hyperlinks should have clear, descriptive anchor text rather than vague phrases like “click here.”</p>

<p>Citations and source attribution are critical to the review’s credibility. All sources must be cited using markdown links or footnotes where appropriate, always linking directly to the original source rather than secondary reports. When citing statistics or studies, writers should include the date and publisher if available to give readers full context and transparency.</p>

<p>When referencing people, the review uses full names on first mention and last names only thereafter. Titles such as Mr., Ms., or Dr. are used only if directly relevant to the story. Writers should avoid honorifics or editorializing adjectives like “controversial” or “renowned” unless those descriptors are directly relevant and supported by sources.</p>

<p>For sensitive topics involving race, gender, religion, and other identity markers, the review emphasizes respect and careful language. People-first language is standard—for example, “person with a disability” rather than “disabled person.” Stereotypes and generalizations are strictly avoided to ensure fair and respectful representation of all communities.</p>

<p>Visual elements in the review follow consistent formatting standards. Captions for images must be concise and descriptive, properly crediting the source or photographer. All images must be used with permission and include alt text to improve accessibility for all readers.</p>]]></content><author><name>the SPR Editoral Board</name></author><category term="meta" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contributors are expected to write in accordance with the review's style as outlined in this article.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/articles/dictionary.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/articles/dictionary.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
