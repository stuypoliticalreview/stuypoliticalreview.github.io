    <p>The Stuyvesant Political Review (SPR) is Stuyvesant’s newest student-run journal dedicated to politics and public policy at the local, national, and international levels. Founded in the 2025–2026 school year, SPR was created to fill a unique gap in Stuyvesant’s club landscape by offering a publication-based, non-competitive platform for political writing and analysis. While other clubs focus on debate, casual discussion, or broader journalism, none combine non-partisan political research, long-form student writing, and a collaborative editorial process the way we do.</p>

<p>Our mission is to create an open and welcoming space where students can explore important political topics through in-depth research, publication, and constructive dialogue. In an era where political awareness is more important than ever, SPR helps members become informed citizens, critical thinkers, and effective communicators. Articles are published twice a year, once in the fall and once in the spring, and we welcome new members at any time.</p>

<p>This year, our goals are to recruit a strong base of members, set up a sustainable meeting structure, publish our first two issues, and establish a polished online presence. We are aiming for around 15 active members by the end of the year, along with a fully functioning website, a clear leadership team, and a welcoming community for new writers.</p>

<p>Our leadership team will include two Co-Editors-in-Chief, a Managing Editor, a Web Editor, a Copy Editor, and a Treasurer. Together, they oversee the editorial vision, manage the publication process, maintain our digital platforms, ensure factual accuracy, and handle budgeting and fundraising. All positions are designed to keep the club running smoothly while maintaining high editorial standards and a non-partisan voice.</p>

<p>A typical SPR meeting blends collaboration, discussion, and independent work. We begin with a rundown of recent political events to spark discussion and article ideas. Members then transition into a writer’s workshop where they can share progress, receive feedback, and work with editors on research and structure. Those still brainstorming can develop ideas, start research, or collaborate with others. As publication deadlines approach, meetings focus on reviewing submissions and preparing content for release. We also plan to host guest speakers who can share insights on political topics relevant to our work.</p>

<p>Meetings will be held once a week for about an hour, with a structured agenda to keep discussions productive. We pause during major exam periods to respect academic priorities, but members can continue to collaborate online.</p>

<p>If you are interested in writing, politics, public policy, or simply becoming a more informed and thoughtful citizen, the Stuyvesant Political Review offers a space to explore your ideas, develop your skills, and share your voice with the community.
