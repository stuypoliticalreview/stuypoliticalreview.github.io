    <p>The review maintains a formal yet accessible tone throughout all its articles. Writers should aim for clarity and conciseness, avoiding unnecessary jargon while keeping the content informative and engaging. Active voice is preferred as it creates a more direct and compelling narrative. Slang and overly casual expressions should be avoided since the audience, though primarily high school students, expects a polished and respectful style. Opinions must be clear and supported by evidence from multiple sources.</p>

<p>Regarding grammar and usage, the review follows American English conventions, including punctuation and spelling. The Oxford comma is mandatory in all lists to prevent ambiguity. Writers should spell out numbers from one through nine, while numerals are used for 10 and above; exceptions include ages, percentages, and measurements, which should always be in numeral form. While split infinitives are generally discouraged, clarity should never be sacrificed for strict grammatical adherence.</p>

<p>In formatting, headlines use title case, capitalizing major words, while subheadings employ sentence case, capitalizing only the first word and proper nouns. Paragraphs are kept short and digestible, ideally ranging from three to five sentences to maintain reader engagement. Markdown formatting is used consistently, with italics for emphasis and bold for strong emphasis. Hyperlinks should have clear, descriptive anchor text rather than vague phrases like “click here.”</p>

<p>Citations and source attribution are critical to the review’s credibility. All sources must be cited using markdown links or footnotes where appropriate, always linking directly to the original source rather than secondary reports. When citing statistics or studies, writers should include the date and publisher if available to give readers full context and transparency.</p>

<p>When referencing people, the review uses full names on first mention and last names only thereafter. Titles such as Mr., Ms., or Dr. are used only if directly relevant to the story. Writers should avoid honorifics or editorializing adjectives like “controversial” or “renowned” unless those descriptors are directly relevant and supported by sources.</p>

<p>For sensitive topics involving race, gender, religion, and other identity markers, the review emphasizes respect and careful language. People-first language is standard—for example, “person with a disability” rather than “disabled person.” Stereotypes and generalizations are strictly avoided to ensure fair and respectful representation of all communities.</p>

<p>Visual elements in the review follow consistent formatting standards. Captions for images must be concise and descriptive, properly crediting the source or photographer. All images must be used with permission and include alt text to improve accessibility for all readers.</p>
